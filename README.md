This is a collection of python programs from 12 Python Projects at Free Code Camp. For each project I started on my own and would refer to the tutorial when I would get stuck. All the scripts are commented to help the user understand what each line does.

Hangman
    Initially the user will be given 7 lives and - for each letter in the word that hasn't been guessed. The user will continue to guess letters until they run out of lives or solve the puzzle. Each turn they will print the lives, blanks, and letters the user has guessed.     If you attempt to guess the same letter twice you will get a unique message saying you have already guessed that letter and your lives will remain the same.
    
Tic-Tac-Toe
     The user will input a number that coressponds to a square on the board. After the users turn the board will be updated with an "X" in the user defined square and an "O" from the computer's turn.
